    <h2>Software</h2>
    <br>
    <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software">Cura Slicer</a>
    <p>This is the software that is used to translate your 3D models into something that the 3D printer can print
        with. It does require a survey before you can download it, it is <b>Free</b> and it does <b>NOT</b> need an
        email address</p>

    <h2>Videos</h2>

        Playlist</a>
    <p>This playlist provided a lof of useful knowledge to me when I began 3D printing. I initially began with
        'What should you print first', '10 places to get free 3d printing files', and 'The best way to orient your
        prints' videos. After those I suggest watching any video that you feel is important to you. Such as if you
        want to make pieces that can withstand a bit more abuse, watch the '3D print stronger parts' video. </p>

    <p>This is a guide that is written for the Simplify 3D slicing software yet provides enough help to be useful
        with nearly any slicer.</p>
